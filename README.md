# Image Compression using Huffman Coding
In 1952 David Huffman, a graduate student at the famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed an elegant algorithm for lossless compression as part of his schoolwork. The algorithm is now known as Huffman coding.
Huffman coding can be used to compress all sorts of data. It is an entropy-based algorithm that relies on an analysis of the frequency of symbols in an array.

## Algoritm of Huffman coding
The image compression techniques are categorized into two
main classifications namely ```Lossy compression``` techniques
and ```Lossless compression``` techniques.

### Lossless Compression
A technique in which the compressed image is
reconstructed without any loss of data is called lossless
compression. Lossless compression ratio gives good quality
of compressed images, but yields only less compression.

### Lossy Compression
 A technique in which the compressed image is
reconstructed with loss of data is called lossy compression.
The lossy compression techniques lead to loss of data with
higher compression ratio.

Huffman coding is loss less technique with more
attractive features in various application such as medical
survey and analysis, technical drawing etc. Huffman coding
has better characteristics of image compression.
